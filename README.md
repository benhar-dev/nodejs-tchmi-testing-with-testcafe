## Overview

This is a small example of running a test with [TestCafe](https://testcafe.io/) and TwinCAT HMI.

## Getting started

You must have node.js installed on your system

1. Clone the repo
2. Open the command prompt to .\src\testcafe-example\ and type `npm install`
3. Open the TwinCAT HMI project and start it in live view
4. Copy the URL and paste this in to the .\src\testcafe-example\tests\click-button-sets-label.js

```js
fixture`Getting Started`.page`{{paste your URL here}}`;
```

5. To run the test, open the command prompt to .\src\testcafe-example\ and type `npm run test`

## Expanding the example

The test included will check that upon clicking the button "TcHmiButton" the label "TcHmiTextblock" is correctly updated to show the text "Button pressed!"

You can place as many tests in the test folder as you like. They will all be called in sequence.
